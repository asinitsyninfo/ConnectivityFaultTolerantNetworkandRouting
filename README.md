Abstract—The article presents an effective algorithm for
constructing a fault-tolerant network for the case when any few
vertices (nodes) could be failed, and the remaining nodes
continue to function with some probability. Fault tolerance
means providing graph connectivity, defined as an undirected
weighted graph without cycles.This algorithm also generates a
list of route priorities for each node, guaranteeing the maximum
probability of connectivity. An important aspect is to minimize
the difference between the original and fault-tolerant graph.
Keywords—fault-tolerant network, routing priority, minimum
spanning tree, genetic algorithm, parallel computing, graph library
